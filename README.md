# Financial Real-Time Streaming Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements a real-time financial data streaming pipeline. It is designed to consume live financial data, transform it, and store the processed data for further analysis. The pipeline is built using Python and is integrated with a **Producer-Consumer** architecture for efficient data streaming.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Streaming**: Uses producers and consumers to simulate a financial data pipeline.
- **Data Transformation**: Raw financial data is transformed into a structured format.
- **Efficient Data Flow**: Uses Python's threading and queue modules for real-time data flow.
- **Scalability**: Can handle a high volume of data, making it suitable for financial institutions.

## Architecture

The pipeline consists of three main components:
1. **Producer**: Simulates the generation of financial data and sends it to a queue.
2. **Consumer**: Receives data from the queue and performs data transformation.
3. **Data Storage**: Processed data is saved in a CSV format for easy access.

### Architecture Diagram

You can use a diagram to represent the flow of the pipeline. Here is an example structure you can include:

```plaintext
Producer -> Data Queue -> Consumer -> Data Transformation -> Transformed Data Storage (CSV)
```

Alternatively, you can use **Lucidchart** or **Draw.io** to create a more detailed and graphical architecture diagram and add it to the repo as an image.

## File Descriptions

- **`producer.py`**: Contains the logic for simulating the producer that generates live financial data.
- **`consumer.py`**: Consumes data from the queue and performs transformation tasks.
- **`data_transformation.py`**: Defines the functions used to transform raw data into structured, cleaned data.
- **`transformed_stock_data.csv`**: Example of transformed stock data after the pipeline processes it.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prembammidi/financial_real_time_streaming_pipeline.git
   cd financial_real_time_streaming_pipeline
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the producer and consumer:**
   - Start the producer:
     ```bash
     python producer.py
     ```
   - Start the consumer:
     ```bash
     python consumer.py
     ```

4. **Check the transformed data:**
   - After the pipeline runs, the processed data will be saved in `transformed_stock_data.csv`.

## Contributions
Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Contributions are always welcome!

### **2. Add an Architecture Diagram**
Visual representations make it easier for users to understand the workflow. Use a tool like **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, or **Microsoft Visio** to create a diagram that shows how the components in your project interact.

Example:
- **Producer**: Generates financial data (could simulate stock prices or other financial metrics).
- **Queue**: A buffer that holds data until it's ready to be consumed.
- **Consumer**: Processes the data by applying transformations.
- **Data Storage**: Store the transformed data for analysis.

### **3. Add a Requirements File**
If your project has dependencies (e.g., libraries like `pandas`, `requests`, or `flask`), include a `requirements.txt` file so others can easily set up the project environment.

Example of a `requirements.txt`:
```
pandas==1.3.3
requests==2.26.0
```

To generate this file automatically, run:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### **4. Add Unit Tests**
For a more robust project, consider adding unit tests to ensure your code works as expected. You can create a **`tests/`** folder and add test files like `test_producer.py`, `test_consumer.py`, etc.

You can use **pytest** or **unittest** for testing. Here’s an example of a simple test:

```python
# test_producer.py
import pytest
from producer import generate_data  # Assuming you have this function in producer.py

def test_generate_data():
    result = generate_data()
    assert isinstance(result, dict)  # Ensure the result is in dictionary format
```

### **5. Add Documentation to Your Code**
Make sure each of your Python files is well-documented. Add docstrings to your functions and classes to explain their purpose.

Example:
```python
def generate_data():
    """
    Simulates the generation of financial data for the pipeline.
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing stock data with timestamp.
    """
    # Code for generating data
```

### **6. Add a License**
It’s always a good practice to add a license to your project, especially if you’re sharing it publicly. You can include a simple **MIT License** or choose any other license that fits your project’s purpose.

To add a license, create a `LICENSE` file with the following content for an MIT License:

```

### **Final Steps:**
- Add all files to your GitHub repository, and make sure the README and other docs are clear and detailed.
- **Push changes** to GitHub using:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Enhance README and add architecture diagram"
  git push origin main
  ```

These additions will make your GitHub repository much more user-friendly, clear, and impressive to anyone who views it.
